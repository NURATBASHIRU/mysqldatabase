# A Paint Chemical Retail Store Database

## Project Overview
### This project is a result of crating a structured database for a medium sized chemical retail store. Transfering all records into a database in order to allow all kinds of data usage and proper data protection. This method of storage will allow further data analysis and the different steps of analysis for the data collected.

## A Little Story About This Data: 
## Growing up, I remember spending most of my holiday breaks at my mom's shop (a retail chemical store), assisting. I remember the first few weeks I spent trying to remember proces and names of each chemicals as well as their various functions. Over time, I got a full grasp of each names and prices but then with each level of mastery comes another level of difficulty - inventory and stock taking, appropriate storage procedure and preventive measures (for highly inflamable products) and first aid measures. I remember struggling with inventory and stock taking most of the time because it took a while for me to realise that every onze and grams matters in order to derive actual salesprices and profit margin. Also, because prices are not stable - prices are solely affected by exchange rate, cost of transportation, labour and profit margin.

## Just like every other businesses, record keeping has been an integral factor of every business activity and growth in the long run. However, over the years, profit margin drastically reduced which has made record keeping more compellingin order to measure projections and make informed business decisions while remaining healthily competitive.

## Therefore, this script originates from a real life experience. Although, some variables used - like prices nd quantity - are imaginary but they are close to actual figures and have been carefully structured to suit the purpose of this session.

## Furthermore, this relational database contains 5 tables; suppliers, salesrecord, inventory, customers and references. Some of which references another and can be joined using multiple join clauses and can be used to perform various query tasks. Also, quantity is expressed in kilogram and 'productcode' was designed for the purpose of this exercise.



### Data Structure;
#### Inventory: A record of goods purchased at once, the prices and condition (the condition it was received in)
#### Suppliers: A record of differnt product suppliers, their contacts, addresses, prices of each product
